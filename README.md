# Kalman Transformer Filter

This repository contains a project that implements and experiments with Kalman Filters and Transformer models. The aim is to integrate these two methods to enhance time-series prediction and filtering processes, leveraging the strengths of both the Kalman Filter for real-time prediction and the Transformer for handling sequence data.

## Features

- **Kalman Filter**: A robust algorithm used for predicting the state of a dynamic system in real time.
- **Transformer Model**: A deep learning architecture that excels in sequential data prediction tasks.
- **Integration**: Combining the Kalman Filter with Transformer models for enhanced performance on time-series data.
